# Privacy Policy for Birthday Adapter

Last updated: 2025-12-18

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our app.

## Information Collection and Use

Our app requires access to the contact accounts on your device (via the `android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS` permission) for the sole purpose of creating and managing a sync account for your birthdays. This allows the app to integrate with the Android account system and provide background synchronization.

We do not collect, store, or share any of your account information for any other purpose. The data is only used locally on your device to enable the synchronization service.
