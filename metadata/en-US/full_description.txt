<b>Description</b>
Birthday Adapter provides birthdays, anniversaries, and other events from your contacts as a real calendar, which is displayed in your standard Android calendar application.
To my knowledge, this is the first implementation that implements birthdays as a calendar displayed in Android's Calendar app.
All other apps only displays their own lists but have no real integration!

<b>Features</b>
• Total integration of birthdays, anniversaries, and other events from Android's contacts as a calendar
• Color picker for the birthday calendar
• Event Reminders
• Jubilee markers
• Filter contact events based on account
