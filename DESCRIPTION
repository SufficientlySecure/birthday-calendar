<b>Description</b>
Birthday Adapter provides birthdays, anniversaries, and other events from your contacts to the Android calendar system, which is displayed in your standard Android calendar application.
To my knowledge, this is the first implementation that implements birthdays as a calendar displayed in Android's Calendar app.
All other apps only displays their own lists but have no real integration!

<b>Features</b>
• Total integration of birthdays, anniversaries, and other events from Android's contacts to the Android calendar system
• Color picker for the birthday calendar
• Event Reminders
• Jubilee markers
• Filter contact events based on account and contact groups
• Customize all event titles
• Chose which events will have reminders
