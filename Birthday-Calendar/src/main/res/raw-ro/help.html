<h2>How does Birthday Adapter work?</h2>
<p>Birthday Adapter creates a new SyncAdapter on your Android device, which synchronizes all events, like birthdays, anniversaries and so on, from your contacts into a calendar. This calendar is displayed in your standard Android Calendar application.</p>

<h2>I want to synchronize the events into an existing calendar!</h2>
<p>This is not the idea of this app. As you already have all birthdays in your contacts and synchronizing these into the cloud, it would be redundant to also synchronize a calendar with the same information. Instead use tools on your desktop pc to display the birthdays from your contacts in your calendar, like Birthday Adapter does. In Thunderbird this can be done with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/thunderbirthday/">Thunderbirthday Add-on</a>.</p>

<h2>How often are contact events synchronized into the calendar?</h2>
<p>This is done once a day and invoked by Android itself together with other synchronizations.</p>

<h2>The synchronization isn't working!</h2>
<p>Please check the following:
<ul>
<li>Is synchronization enabled on your device? (You can enable/disable synchronization application-wide, for example with Androids power widget)</li>
</ul>
